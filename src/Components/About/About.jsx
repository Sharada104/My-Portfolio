              Hi, I'm Sharada Hiremath, a Front-End Developer with 6 months of
              hands-on internship experience building responsive and interactive
              web applications. During my internship, I worked with technologies
              like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, translating UI/UX designs
              into real-world user experiences. I gained experience
              collaborating with developers and designers, debugging
              cross-browser issues, and building reusable components. Iâ€™m
              passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and continuously
              learning modern front-end trends. I'm currently looking for
              opportunities to contribute to exciting projects where I can grow
              as a developer and create meaningful user experiences.
